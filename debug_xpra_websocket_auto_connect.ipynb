    "\n",
    "The user discovered that the auto-connect feature bypasses our custom ProxyCompatibleWebSocket implementation. Looking at the logs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ‚úÖ **WebSocket connects**: `üéâ ProxyCompatibleWebSocket: Connection opened`\n",
    "2. ‚ùå **Xpra validation fails**: `XpraConnection#disconnect cs: Not a valid xpra server?`\n",
    "3. üîÑ **Reconnect triggered**: `üîå Xpra disconnected with status: reconnecting`\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue is that while our ProxyCompatibleWebSocket connects successfully, the xpra-html5-client library internally might be creating its own WebSocket connections that bypass our custom implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Required Libraries** - Set up debugging tools\n",
    "2. **Define ProxyCompatibleWebSocket Class** - Our custom implementation  \n",
    "3. **Create Xpra Client Configuration** - Proper setup for proxy compatibility\n",
    "4. **Implement Auto-Connection Logic** - Fix the bypass issue\n",
    "5. **Handle Connection States** - Manage reconnection properly\n",
    "6. **Test Protocol Negotiation** - Debug binary protocol issues\n",
