We welcome contributions to the JupyterLab Firefox Launcher! This guide will help you get started with contributing to the project, whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or helping with testing.

## Getting Started

### Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the project:

- üêõ **Bug Reports**: Report issues and help improve stability
- ‚ú® **Feature Requests**: Suggest new features and enhancements
- üîß **Code Contributions**: Fix bugs, implement features, improve performance
- üìö **Documentation**: Improve docs, add examples, write tutorials
- üß™ **Testing**: Write tests, test new features, report compatibility issues
- üåê **Translation**: Help translate the extension to other languages
- üí¨ **Community Support**: Help other users in discussions and issues

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues**: Search [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/vantagecompute/jupyterlab-firefox-launcher/issues) to see if your idea or bug has already been reported
2. **Read the documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the [architecture]({{ site.baseurl }}/architecture) and [development guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/development)
3. **Join the discussion**: Participate in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vantagecompute/jupyterlab-firefox-launcher/discussions) to connect with the community

## Setting Up Development Environment

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jupyterlab-firefox-launcher.git
cd jupyterlab-firefox-launcher

# Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/vantagecompute/jupyterlab-firefox-launcher.git
```

### 2. Development Setup

```bash
# Install system dependencies (see Dependencies guide)
sudo apt install -y xvfb dbus-x11 xpra firefox  # Ubuntu/Debian

# Set up Python environment
uv venv dev-env
source dev-env/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Set up frontend
jlpm install
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite

# Install pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
pre-commit install
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
# Run tests to ensure everything works
pytest
jlpm test

# Start JupyterLab to test the extension
jupyter lab
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Make sure you're on the main branch and up to date
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

Follow our development guidelines:

#### Code Style Guidelines

**Python Code:**
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- Use [isort](https://isort.readthedocs.io/) for import sorting
- Add type hints where appropriate
- Write descriptive docstrings

```python
def create_session_directory(port: int) -> Path:
    """Create an isolated session directory for Firefox instance.
    
    Args:
        port: Port number for the session
        
    Returns:
        Path to the created session directory
        
    Raises:
        OSError: If directory creation fails
    """
    # Implementation here
```

**TypeScript Code:**
- Follow JupyterLab coding standards
- Use explicit types where possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Document complex logic with comments

```typescript
interface SessionConfig {
  port: number;
  quality: number;
  dpi: number;
}

/**
 * Create a new Firefox session with specified configuration
 */
async function createSession(config: SessionConfig): Promise<SessionInfo> {
  // Implementation here
}
```

**Commit Message Format:**
Use conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- docs: documentation changes
- style: formatting changes
- refactor: code refactoring
- test: adding tests
- chore: maintenance tasks
```

Examples:
```
feat(frontend): add session timeout configuration
fix(handler): resolve memory leak in cleanup process
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(handler): add unit tests for session management
```

### 3. Testing Your Changes

#### Run All Tests
```bash
# Python tests
pytest

# Python tests with coverage
pytest --cov=jupyterlab_firefox_launcher

# Frontend tests
jlpm test

# Integration tests
python tests/test_integration.py
```

#### Manual Testing
```bash
# Start JupyterLab and test functionality
jupyter lab

# Test with debug logging enabled
FIREFOX_LAUNCHER_DEBUG=1 jupyter lab

# Test multi-session scenarios
# Test cleanup functionality
# Test error handling
```

#### Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Format Python code
black jupyterlab_firefox_launcher/
isort jupyterlab_firefox_launcher/

# Type checking
mypy jupyterlab_firefox_launcher/

# Linting
flake8 jupyterlab_firefox_launcher/

# Frontend linting
jlpm run eslint
```

### 4. Update Documentation

If your changes affect user-facing functionality:

- Update relevant documentation pages
- Add or update code comments
- Update API documentation if needed
- Add examples if applicable

### 5. Commit and Push

```bash
# Add your changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat(handler): implement session timeout handling"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```
