# Xsession Warning Resolution

## Issue: "Xsession: unable to launch 'true' X session --- 'true' not found; falling back"

This warning message may appear when starting Firefox sessions with older versions of Xpra (particularly v3.1.x). This is a **harmless warning** that does not affect the functionality of the Firefox launcher.

### What's Happening

1. **Default Behavior**: Xpra v3.1.x automatically starts `/etc/X11/Xsession true` as a default session command
2. **Xsession Script**: The system's Xsession script tries to launch `true` as an X session, which is not a typical X application
3. **Fallback**: The Xsession script detects this and falls back to a minimal session
4. **Firefox Launches**: Our custom `firefox-xstartup` script launches Firefox successfully regardless

### Technical Details

- **Xpra Command**: We use `--start=` to try to override the default session startup
- **Version Limitation**: Xpra v3.1.x still runs the default Xsession despite the override
- **Actual Impact**: None - Firefox launches correctly and the session works properly
- **Session Management**: The warning does not affect multi-session support or cleanup

### Resolution Status

✅ **Firefox functionality works correctly**
✅ **Multi-session support is not affected**
✅ **Session cleanup works properly**
⚠️ **Warning message appears but can be safely ignored**

### How to Verify Everything is Working

1. **Check Firefox Launch**: Firefox should open in the browser
2. **Check Logs**: Look for "Firefox test script starting" or similar success messages
3. **Check Session Exit**: Sessions should terminate cleanly when closed
4. **Check Multi-Session**: Multiple sessions should work without interference

### If You Want to Eliminate the Warning

**Option 1: Upgrade Xpra** (Recommended)
```bash
# For newer Xpra versions that have better session control
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xpra  # Install latest available version
```

**Option 2: Custom Xsession** (Advanced)
- Create a custom Xsession script that handles the `true` argument properly
- This is complex and generally not necessary

### Bottom Line

The "Xsession: unable to launch 'true'" warning is **cosmetic only** and can be safely ignored. The Firefox launcher extension works correctly despite this warning.

If you see Firefox opening in your browser and sessions working properly, everything is functioning as intended.
